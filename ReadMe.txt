Hello and thank you for checking out Simple Weather, an easy to use weather App by Tom Mahle.

This app is designed to be installed on a standard web server and beginner-level instructions for setting one up can be found at: 
http://www.howtogeek.com/177129/beginner-geek-how-to-host-your-own-website-on-windows-wamp/
as of the time of this document's writing.

Once you have the server up and running simply place the files from this project into the 'www directory' if you used the wamp server above or the active directory of the web server if you are setting up a server by another means. Please make sure not to enable https for this site. No installation or building is necessary on the side of the user. Once the server has been set up the app will run natively in any modern web browser.

If you'd like to skip the server installation you can run the index.html file directly by double-clicking it in order to open it in your default browser. Please note that some features may not function when running with this method and also that the app requires access to hosted libraries and the OpenWeatherMap API. In other words, it is intrinsically online and cannot be run without an internet connection.

I hope you enjoy Simple Weather. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions at TomMahle@gmail.com
